# Q-learning-with-neural-networks
ROB 6323 Reinforcement Learning and Optimal Control for Robotics || Project - SQP &amp; MPC || Fall 2024

## **Abstract**  
This project implements **Q-learning with a neural network** to solve the **inverted pendulum** problem. The goal is to find an optimal policy that stabilizes the pendulum in the inverted position while minimizing a predefined cost function. The Q-learning algorithm utilizes a **deep neural network** to approximate the Q-function, with training performed through reinforcement learning.

The implementation includes system dynamics modeling, reward-based learning, and visualization of the learned policy. The code is written in Python using **PyTorch, NumPy, and Matplotlib** for deep reinforcement learning and simulation.
